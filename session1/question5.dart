/* Question 5

each.
*/
/* var is a keyword that is used to replace it by a data type suiatable that is depended
 on the value type that will store in the same statemnt, but if does not assign a value in
 the same statement it is automaticially take the dynamic date type, but the dynamic is 
 acutally a data type is used to variables if i can not the suiatable data type but is
a weak data type.
 example of dynamic:  dynamic name = 'ahmed';
                      dynamic num = 4;

 example of var keyword:  var name = 'ahmed'; // ahmed is assigned as a String.

                          var num;
                          num = 5; // but here is a dynamic as we explain.
