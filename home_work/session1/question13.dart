/* Question 13
What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void
main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```
*/
/* Answer: output is 11, as this becuase when we replace x by its value (5), y become 5 + 2 * 3,
because mulitplication has priority y become 5+6 and finally 5+6 = 11 */
